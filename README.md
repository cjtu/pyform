# pyform
A module to import coordinates from .tps files and other common formats used in the morphometrics and geological sciences communities (txt, .csv, .shp, etc.) written in Python. 

Further work intends to translate code written in R and MathematicaÂ® into Python compatible quantitative analysis of morphology in geologic studies. This module focuses particularly on "landmark-free" geologic landforms from remote sensing data and is extensible to nearly all studies of morphology in the geological science community.

This software is in early stages of development (a prime distraction from thesis work). 

If you are interested in contributing to the project, you are welcome to join the project in its early stages.
